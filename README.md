# 🛫 Airport Management System

A simple **Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** project that simulates an Airport Management System.  
This project demonstrates core Java concepts such as classes, objects, constructors, exception handling, and unit testing.

## ✨ Features
- ✈️ Define and manage flights with attributes like flight number, origin, destination, capacity, and price  
- 🧳 Passenger and ticket management through object-oriented classes  
- 👨‍✈️ Manager and staff entities using Java inheritance  
- ❌ Exception handling for invalid flight operations (e.g., same origin/destination, low capacity)  
- ✅ Unit testing with JUnit to validate constructors and methods
